👋 Hey there! I’m Pappu Baraf, a computer science engineering student with a passion for coding and problem-solving. 
Here’s a glimpse into my world:

🌱 Currently, I’m diving deep into computer science engineering, exploring algorithms, data structures, and software development.
💻 My toolbox includes languages like C, Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. I love building cool stuff and turning ideas into code!
🤖 Fascinated by artificial intelligence and machine learning, I’m on a quest to understand how machines can learn and make intelligent decisions.
🚀 Looking to collaborate with like-minded folks on exciting projects. Let’s create something awesome together!

Fun fact: I once wrote a program that generated random haikus about binary trees. 🌳📝

Keep coding, stay curious, and let’s build the future! 🚀✨
